The ERA-5 reanalysis data, for the Texas Interconnect region, is not added in the GitHub repository but is available at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5. The original dataset is in  NetCDF (.nc) format and the NetCDF_to_Text.R script in data/rawdata is used to convert it to text (.txt) format.
